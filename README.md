I want to show you how you can create a time tracking tool with Excel that will help you to organise your time.

This can help you in various situations, e.g. if you want to organise your working time better, or if you have started various projects in your free time. 
I will also create an extra video for students, as this tracking method can help you to keep track of how much you have learnt and how much you still have to learn, 
especially when studying for exams.

The core principle is very simple. 
You have different tables for each project, in which you can enter your working hours for each day with start and end times. 
These times are totalled in an overview table that shows you your working hours per day and per project.

You can download the excel project in this repository.
